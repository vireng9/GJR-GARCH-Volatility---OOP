# GJR-GARCH Volatility Modelling - Object-Oriented-Programming
  Note: Full code files available upon request

## Overview
This repository contains Python code and statistical analysis applying **Object-Oriented-Programming (OOP)** principles to model and evaluate **10 years of financial time series data** using **GJR-GARCH** framework. This captures asymmetric volatility, where negative shocks are more pronounced than positive ones. It reflects market behaviour more accurately during crises or negative shocks, improving volatility forecasting.
- Useful for risk management, scenario analysis, and derivatives pricing by better capturing volatility dynamics.
- Demonstrates better performance in forecasting VaR and during financial market turbulence, distress.
- Widely used in trading and hedging to quantify possible future volatility scenarios more realistically.

The project demonstrates:
- Clean modular design with OOP for financial and statistical modelling.
- Implementation of GJR-GARCH volatility models.
- Empirical analysis of long-term data.
- Exported results in both PDF and ipynb.

## Files
- ipynb shows full interactive notebook with code, outputs and visualizations.
- PDF shows static version for quick review.
- README.md shows project documentation.

## Motivation
Volatility modelling is central to risk management, trading strategies and quantitative finance.
This project showcases:
- Practical application of **GJR-GARCH** to capture asymmetry in volatility.
- Insights from **10 years of historical data**
- How **OOP** can structure complex financial models.
